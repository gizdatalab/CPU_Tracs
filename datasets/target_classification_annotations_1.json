(4) Introduction of a new promotion category for natural gas separation plants which if they are implementing CCUS technologies will be granted 8-year corporate income tax exemptions. Moreover, Thai government envisions the country becoming the largest electric vehicle investment hub in one of the world s fastest-growing economic blocs."

Combination of various coastal zone protection technologies are recommended by the second \u201cTechnology Needs Assessment\u201d report of Georgia to prevent the significant damage caused by the Black Sea level rise. According to the National communications of Georgia to the UNFCCC costs of the coastline adaptation program is estimated about 600 million USD."

This opportunity will enable Thailand to build forward better to become a green economy country after the COVID-19 pandemic. The green economy ecosystem will be accelerated with the goal of reducing greenhouse gas emissions to net-zero."

Thailand\u2019s climate is influenced by two main seasonal monsoon winds: the southwest monsoon and the northeast monsoon. The southwest monsoon starts in May and brings a stream of warm, moist air from the Indian Ocean towards Thailand, causing abundant rain over the country, especially on the windward side of the mountains. The northeast monsoon starts in October and brings cold and dry air from the anticyclone in the Chinese mainland over major parts of Thailand, particularly focused on the north and northeast regions."
